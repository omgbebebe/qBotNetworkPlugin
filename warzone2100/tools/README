************************************DRAFT***************************************

This directory (will) contain all sorts of Warzone 2100 related tools.

 * Each of these tools will have to be Warzone specific.
 * Every independend tool should have one directory of its own
 * No tool should depend on others for compilation or linking.
 * Each of these tools *must* have a "COPYING" file with it in its directory.
  - This file should contain the full licensing conditions applied to the entire tool.
  - If parts of this tool are licensed differently this *must* be made note of in this file.
  - Preferrably all tools should be licensed GPL (or maybe LGPL if it's easily reusable for other projects?).
  - In case the GPL is used it is best copied from /trunk/COPYING using the `svn copy` command.
